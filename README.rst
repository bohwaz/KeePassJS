=========
KeePassJS
=========

A JavaScript port of KeePassLib, providing access to KeePass 1.x files.

Based on the C implementation by Dominik Reichl. http://keepass.info/

This port also wouldn't have been possible without side-by-side
debugging performed against KeePassDroid by Brian Pellin.

Because this is based on a GPL implementation, it must itself be GPL.
I have tried to release as much code as possible under more permissive
licenses, as described in the LICENSE file.
